# DJANGO Websockets DEMO

Small demo project using a few basic techniques (Dom manipulation and setting up a Django Webchannel). Images can be added to the webpage dynamically by using Javascript or by letting the server add them through a webchannel. There is also an option for clearing all the images from the page.

## Setup

Add the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension to Visual Studio Code. Clone the repository and open it in Visual Studio Code. No other installation needed.
